Why Django?
    Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.
    Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development.
    In particular, it makes use of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle so there is no unnecessary duplication,
    reducing the amount of code.

    Django comes with batteries included ,it means that almost all the tools that a web developer may  need
    comes Built in.So one don't have to start literally every plugin from scratch.


How Django saves data?
    Django uses models in 'models.py' file to store data . Models are stored as classes , where each class
    is the table,each attribute it's field and each object it's row.
    These models can be migrated to convert them to tables in sql file.

    For example:
        class SampleModel(models.Model):
            movie = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
            IMDB  = models.IntegerField()
    
            def __str__(self):
                return self.movie

    (In this example SampleModel model is the table in sql, movie and IMDB are it's fields)




How Django accepts the data?
    There are two endpoint urls in django (using django rest api) which accepts both 'GET' and 'POST' requests.
    Using python requests library, post request is sent from computer having face recogntion code . These post
    requests may include user details after registration and attendance/date after taking attendance.

    1.student-endpoint accepts the user details from post request and make a new object of user and student model.
    2.attendance-endpoint the attendance details and create/update the attendance model's object.

Show data?
    In 'views.py' file we use queries and functions to get required data and pass it to template files(html files).
    There may be different views(as functions) in views.py file to pass different data to different templates.
